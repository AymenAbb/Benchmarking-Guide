### CPU Benchmarking
- [Geekbench](https://www.geekbench.com/): Rapid CPU Benchmark
- [3DMark (Trial)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223850/3DMark/): Tests GPU and CPU back to back with their TimeSpy test. Free if you use the trial (which you should).


### CPU Stress Testing
- [Prime95](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/prime95-download.html): Extremely taxing on the CPU, much more so than any real world use case. Use for testing stability, especially on overclocks.

### GPU Benchmarking
- [3DMark (Trial)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223850/3DMark/): Tests GPU and CPU back to back with their TimeSpy test. Free if you use the trial (which you should).

### GPU Stress Testing
- [Furmark](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/): Not much to say other than it cooks your GPU. There's no "score" in the end like Heaven.
- [Unigine Heaven](https://benchmark.unigine.com/heaven): Can be used as a benchmark but I wouldn't as scores are very difficult to compare. This is due to the various amounts of settings you can choose from, I'd select the "Extreme" preset and move on.

### RAM Stress Testing
- [OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/download): Get the personal edition. It can stress test anything but I've found it to be mainly worthwhile for the ram. Go to stability test > memory > do 80% or higher on the memory scale and leave it. Can spit errors within 10 seconds but to be thorough leave it on for a couple hours at 100% memory.
