# Guide to PC Benchmarking & Stress Testing
A simple guide on how to properly benchmark and stress test your PC to check for abnormal performance. Mainly focuses on CPU, GPU, storage, and RAM.

## CPU
---
### Benchmarking
- [Geekbench](https://www.geekbench.com/): Rapid CPU Benchmark
- [3DMark (Trial)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223850/3DMark/): Tests GPU and CPU back to back with their TimeSpy test. Free if you use the trial (which you should).


### Stress Testing
- [Prime95](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/prime95-download.html): Extremely taxing on the CPU, much more so than any real world use case. Use for testing stability, especially on overclocks.
